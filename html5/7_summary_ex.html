2 tablespoons chana dal (optional – adds color)

Salt to taste

Wash rice and soak in water.

Wash urad dal + fenugreek seeds + chana dal and soak separately.

Soak for at least 6 hours (or overnight).

🔹 Grinding

Grind urad dal first with little water to a fluffy smooth batter.

Grind rice to a slightly grainy smooth paste.

Mix both in a large bowl.

Add salt lightly (or after fermentation).

🔹 Fermentation (8–12 hours)

Cover and keep in a warm place overnight.

Batter should double in size and turn airy.

Stir gently before using.

👉 Batter consistency: Pourable but not watery.

Add ¼ cup water to make it soft.

Cook 2–3 minutes.

Add coriander leaves + lemon juice.

Turn off heat.

Filling should be moist, not dry.

🔥 Step 3: Making Masala Dosa

Heat a cast iron tawa or non-stick pan.

Sprinkle a few drops of water (it should sizzle).

Wipe lightly with cloth or onion piece.

Pour one ladle of batter in center.

Spread in circular motion (thin layer).
