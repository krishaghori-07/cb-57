    <h1>bheem and kalia</h1>
    <p>In the green kingdom of <mark>Bheem</mark>, a brave and kind-hearted boy lived in the peaceful village of Dholakpur, where he
        was loved by everyone for his strength and honesty, and among the villagers there was also Kalia, a jealous and
        mischievous boy who often tried to compete with Bheem but never succeeded because Bheem always used his power
        for good while Kalia thought only about winning and showing off, and every day the children of Dholakpur played
        together in the fields and near the river while Bheem protected them from danger and Kalia secretly planned ways
        to defeat him, yet whenever trouble came like a wild animal entering the village or thieves trying to steal
        grain from the storehouse Bheem would rush forward without fear and save the people, and even though Kalia
        wanted to take credit he usually ended up hiding behind a tree or making excuses, but deep inside Kalia wished
        he could be as brave and respected as Bheem, and one day when a giant storm hit Dholakpur and strong winds began
        to destroy huts and trees everyone panicked and ran for safety while Bheem quickly organized the villagers and
        carried heavy logs to block the river water from flooding their homes, and Kalia at first laughed thinking Bheem
        would fail but when  <mark> he saw the danger growing he felt scared and realized that the village truly needed Bheem’s</mark>  
        courage, and as the storm became stronger a huge tree fell near the children and Bheem lifted it with all his
        strength to save them while Kalia watched in shock, and in that moment Kalia understood that true strength was
        not about showing off but about helping others, and after the storm passed the villagers thanked Bheem for his
        bravery and hard work and even Kalia slowly walked up to him feeling ashamed of his jealousy, and Bheem smiled
        warmly and told Kalia that they could work together to make Dholakpur even safer and happier, and from that day
        Kalia tried to change himself though he still made silly plans sometimes, yet he learned that friendship and
        teamwork were more powerful than pride, and the story of Bheem and Kalia teaches that kindness and courage
        always shine brighter than jealousy and that even rivals can become better when they choose the right path, and
        so in the cheerful village of Dholakpur the adventures of Bheem and Kalia continued with laughter, lessons, and
        the hope of true friendship growing stronger each day.
